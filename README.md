An Application for Controlling a network of external nodes containing sensors and controllers.  Sensors are used to read the environment for example temperature, humidity and light levels. Controllers are used to adjust the environment for example, heaters, coolers, lights and pumps.  The application automatically reads ans saves sensor readings to the database and allows for the manual control of controllers. the greatest value of the application is its ability to use business rules to automatically adjust the controller settings in real time response to the sensor readings

the application is located in two repositories, the react front-end "Rhobos_project_react" and the express back-end "Rhobos_project", https://github.com/tamaradesmith/Rhobos_project.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
